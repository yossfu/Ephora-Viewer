# OpenGL ES 3 Rendering Engine

> Status: **Primary** as of branch `claude/opengl-rendering-engine-LCKVz`.
> Filament has been demoted to an opt-in fallback after persistent
> driver-level crashes on Adreno/Mali devices and friction with the
> Second Life / OpenSim asset pipeline.

This document covers the architecture of Linkpoint's hand-rolled OpenGL
ES 3.0+ renderer, its lineage from existing Second Life viewers, the
producer plumbing that feeds it, and the migration path off Filament.

---

## 1. Reference lineage

The renderer is descended from four lines of Second Life viewer
implementation, in approximate order of how directly we copied them:

| Reference | What we took |
|---|---|
| **Lumiya Viewer** (Android, GL ES 2 originally) | Surface view + render loop pattern, drawable store layout, shader naming, asset-bundled GLSL, FXAA post-process, sky-dome depth trick. Linkpoint's `render/lumiya/` subtree is a near-isomorphic Kotlin port. |
| **Singularity Viewer** (desktop LL fork) | LLPipeline-style pass orchestration, LLDrawPool material grouping, LLSpatialPartition octree concepts. Reflected in `LumiyaRenderer`'s pass list and `spatial/FrustumCuller`. |
| **Firestorm + official LL viewer** | Render-target chain, ALM lighting hints, Windlight environment params (sun direction, ambient/diffuse split, haze, water height). Reflected in `LumiyaRenderContext`'s windlight block. |
| **Lumiya's `WorldViewRenderer.java`** specifically | The 12-stage frame plan: prep → FXAA FBO → clear → opaque world → avatars → sky → transparent → water → particles → HUD → FXAA resolve → cleanup. |

LL viewer naming for code reading directly against Singularity /
Firestorm sources.

## 3. GL ES 3.0 minimum target

We target **OpenGL ES 3.0** as the floor. The only feature we
hard-require beyond ES 2 is uniform buffer objects (used for the global
matrix block and per-avatar joint palettes); everything else degrades
when absent.

| Feature | Required | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| UBO (`glBindBufferBase`) | yes | Global view/proj/camera/sun block; per-avatar joint palette (max 64 joints) |
| VAO | yes | Per-shape vertex layout cached once at startup |
| Immutable textures (`glTexStorage2D`) | yes | sRGB albedo + linear non-color |
| Mipmaps + trilinear | yes | All sampled textures |
| sRGB framebuffer (`GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8`) | yes | Albedo gamma correctness on write |
| MRT | optional | Future deferred path |
| Instanced draws | optional | Terrain patches, particles |
| Transform feedback | optional | GPU particle update |
| ETC2 / ASTC | optional | Compressed texture upload (GPU bandwidth) |
| Compute shaders (ES 3.1) | optional | Future GPU-driven culling |
| `GL_EXT_buffer_storage` | optional | Persistent-mapped global UBO (auto-detected) |

Capability detection runs in `LumiyaRenderContext.queryGPUCapabilities`
and reports vendor/renderer/version into `RenderDiagnostics`. The
renderer's behavior degrades silently when an optional path is missing.

---

## 4. Frame plan

Driven by `LumiyaFramePlanner.createPlan` and executed in
`LumiyaRenderer.renderFrame`:

```
1. beginFrame()              → frameNumber++, deltaTime, waterTime
2. onBeforeFrame(dt)         → producer hook (avatar pose tick, etc.)
3. updateCamera()            → look-at + perspective + frustum extract
4. uploadGlobalUBO()         → proj + view + model + camPos + sunDir
5. Bind FXAA FBO if enabled
6. Clear color + depth + stencil

7. WORLD_OPAQUE              → terrain, opaque prims (front-to-back)
8. WORLD_AVATAR              → tracked avatars (skinned)
9. WORLD_SKY                 → dome behind everything via depth trick
10. WORLD_TRANSPARENT        → alpha prims (back-to-front)
11. WORLD_WATER              → animated water plane
12. WORLD_PARTICLES          → billboards
13. HUD                      → orthographic 2D pass

14. Resolve FXAA back to default FBO
15. resourceManager.cleanup() → drain deferred deletes
```

The HUD pass swaps in an orthographic projection then restores the
3D matrices, mirroring Lumiya's `WorldViewRenderer` HUD path.

---

## 5. Producer pipeline

Protocol → `RenderCommandStream` → consumers. This is the canonical
data path; both engines subscribe to the same stream.

```
ObjectUpdate / TerrainData / etc.
              │
              ▼
   LinkpointApp.publishRenderCommand
              │
              ▼
        RenderCommandStream
            (SharedFlow)
              │
       ┌──────┴──────┐
       ▼             ▼
 FilamentRender   Gles3Render
 CommandConsumer  CommandConsumer
       │             │
       ▼             ▼
 Filament thread   GL thread
 (RenderManager)   (LumiyaGLSurfaceView)
```

`Gles3RenderCommandConsumer` handles:

- `UpsertPrim` — `engine.addObject` (or `LumiyaRenderer.upsertAvatar`
  for `pcode == 47`); kicks off a default-face texture fetch.
- `UpsertMesh` — best-effort: still binds the texture entry's default
  face. Geometry compilation is a follow-up; the consumer logs a
  placeholder rather than dropping the asset.
- `UpdateMaterial` — re-binds the default face texture; if a fallback
  ObjectUpdate is attached, also re-upserts the prim (matches Filament
  semantics so material updates can repair a missed prim).
- `RemoveEntity` — `engine.removeObject` + `removeAvatar` if a full UUID
  was supplied.
- `SetCamera` — forwards to `RenderEngineProvider.setCameraPosition/Target`.
- `SetTerrainPatch` — accumulates 16×16 patches into a 256×256 region
  heightmap and re-uploads as a 257×257 vertex grid.

### Texture binding flow

```
UpsertPrim arrives
  │
  ▼
TextureEntryParser.extractTextureIds(entry)
  │
  ▼
TextureFetcher.fetch(uuid, onResolved)
  │  (suspend in applicationScope; calls TextureManager.getTexture)
  ▼
Bitmap delivered to onResolved
  │
  ▼
glThreadExecutor { LumiyaRenderer.uploadTextureForPrim(...) }
  │
  ▼
GLTextureCache.put(uuid, bitmap, ALBEDO)  →  GL handle
  │
  ▼
DrawablePrimStore.setPrimTexture(primId, handle)
```

### Avatar pose flow

`wireGlesDataPipelines` installs `LumiyaRenderer.onBeforeFrame`. On every
frame, on the GL thread, before any draws:

1. For each tracked avatar:
   - `animator.update(deltaTime)` — advance keyframes
   - `skeleton.updateBoneMatrices()` — recompute world joints
   - `skeleton.getSkinningMatrices()` — flatten to `FloatArray`
   - `LumiyaRenderer.updateAvatarJoints(id, matrices, count)` — upload
     to the per-avatar joint UBO

This replaces the Filament-only `RenderManager.avatarPoseProvider`
hook, which never fired when the GL backend was active because
`RenderManager`'s own draw loop wasn't scheduled.

---

## 6. Backend selection

User-visible preference: `renderer_backend` (string).

| Value | Backend | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `opengl` *(default)* | Lumiya GL ES 3 | Primary path |
| `gles` | Lumiya GL ES 3 | Alias |
| `lumiya` | Lumiya GL ES 3 | Alias |
| `filament` | Google Filament | Opt-in fallback |

For backwards compatibility with the Filament-default era, the legacy
`enable_secondary_renderer` boolean is honored if `renderer_backend`
is unset, and its default has been flipped to `true` so unset
installs land on OpenGL.

The runtime engine swap is orchestrated by `RendererHandoffManager`:
pause → flush → dispose → attach new + replay snapshot. Either
direction is supported with no app restart.

---

## 7. Filament migration path

Filament code remains in-tree; nothing was deleted. To strip Filament
in a future cleanup pass, the surface area is:

| Area | File | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | `render/backend/FilamentBackend.kt` | Remove + `RenderEngineSwitcher` enum entry |
| Renderers | `render/RenderManager.kt`, `prims/`, `terrain/`, `water/`, `environment/`, `particles/` | Filament types (`Engine`, `Renderer`, `Scene`, `View`, `Camera`, `RenderableManager`) need to be replaced with calls into the GL drawables, OR these renderers can be deleted entirely once the GL drawable equivalents are at parity. |
| Materials | `render/materials/MaterialLoader.kt`, `FilamentMaterialTranslator.kt` | Already paired with `GlesMaterialTranslator.kt`; the loader can be deleted once nothing reads `.mat` files. |
| Texture upload | `render/RenderManager.uploadBitmapAsTexture` | Replace callers with `LumiyaRenderer.uploadTextureForPrim`. |
| Build | `Linkpoint/build.gradle.kts` (filament-android, gltfio-android, filamat-android, filament-utils-android) | Remove the four `1.66.0` dependencies. |
| Activities | `ui/render/FilamentTestActivity.kt`, `FilamentWorldViewActivity.kt` | Delete or redirect to the GL surface. |
| Command consumer | `render/scene/commands/FilamentRenderCommandConsumer.kt`, `LinkpointApp.filamentCommandConsumer` | Remove the consumer; the stream itself stays. |

We deliberately did **not** do the full strip in this branch — keeping
Filament available means we can A/B test on devices where the GL path
regresses, and roll back the default if needed.

---

## 8. Roadmap completion status

The original known-gaps list from the flip-default-to-GL milestone is
now closed. Each item below has landed on this branch:

- **Real prim shape dispatch** — `DrawablePrimStore` now ships unit
  VAOs for box / sphere / cylinder / torus / prism / ring and chooses
  between them via `shapeFromParams(PrimShapeParams)`. The chooser
  mirrors LL viewer's `LLVolumeParams` heuristic
  (PATH_CIRCLE × PROFILE_CIRCLE → sphere, PATH_LINE × PROFILE_TRI →
  prism, etc.). Per-prim scale lives on the model matrix; AABBs
  derive from scale × 0.5. Draws are batched by shape so VAO binds
  are O(shape count), not O(prim count).
- **Per-face material binding** — `DrawablePrimStore.PrimInstance` now
  carries a `MutableList<FaceMaterial>`. `applyTextureEntry` calls
  `TextureEntryParser.parseFull(entry, faceCountFor(shape))` and
  populates per-face textureId, tint, scaleS/T, offsetS/T, rotation.
  The renderer builds a UV transform matrix per face on the fly. Same
  treatment in `DrawableMeshStore` for mesh-asset prims (one face per
  mesh submesh).
- **Mesh asset compilation** — new `DrawableMeshStore` ports
  `MeshPrimRenderer`'s upload logic to GL ES 3 VAOs. Each unique mesh
  asset compiles once into a list of per-face VAOs (interleaved
  POS/NORMAL/UV, location 0/1/2 matching `PrimShaderProgram`); per-prim
  instances reference the shared compiled mesh. Wired through
  `LumiyaRenderer.upsertMeshPrim` and called from
  `Gles3RenderCommandConsumer.handleUpsertMesh`.
- **Picking** — `LumiyaRenderer.pickPrim(screenX, screenY)` uses
  `GLRayTrace.screenToWorldRay` plus a slab-method ray-vs-AABB test
  against every prim and returns the closest hit's localId.
  `WorldViewActivity` wires `GestureDetector.onSingleTapUp` to
  `handleWorldTap`, which posts onto the GL thread and pops a Toast
  with the picked SL object's name on the UI thread.
- **3D hover text** — new `DrawableHoverText` renders text labels via
  Android Canvas → bitmap → GL texture, drawn as a screen-aligned
  billboard at the prim's world anchor + AABB top. Uses the existing
  `PrimShaderProgram` (no new shader). Distance-scaled font with a
  legibility floor + ceiling. Driven by `LumiyaRenderer.setHoverText`.
- **Occlusion queries** — new
  `render/lumiya/spatial/OcclusionQuerySet` wraps
  `glBeginQuery(GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED_CONSERVATIVE)`.
  `LumiyaRenderer.occlusionQueries` exposes the pool;
  `DrawablePrimStore.drawOpaque` consults `shouldDraw(primId)` per
  prim before issuing the draw + query pair, then `harvest()` polls
  results post-frame. Fail-open semantics: if the result isn't ready
  we keep last frame's decision (no GPU stall). Off by default — toggle
  via `lumiyaRenderer.occlusionQueries.setEnabled(true)`.
- **Responsive throttle** — `LumiyaRenderer.beginInteractiveThrottle()`
  / `endInteractiveThrottle()` flip a flag that
  `LumiyaFramePlanner.createPlan` honours by skipping the particle
  pass, and that `renderFrame` honours by bypassing the FXAA FBO +
  resolve. `WorldViewActivity` hooks `onScroll` /
  `onFling` / `ACTION_UP` to begin and end throttling.

### What's still followup

- **Per-face draw split for non-mesh prims.** `DrawablePrimStore`
  has the per-face material data and uses face[0] for the bind, but
  the unit shape VAOs are unsplit — face[1..n] data is parsed
  but doesn't drive a separate draw call. Most prims look correct
  with face[0] (one tint, one texture). To split per-face we need
  per-face index ranges in each shape VAO.
- **GPU skinning.** `DrawableMeshStore` keeps `MeshFace.jointIndices`
  / `weights` on the CPU-side data structure but renders rigged
  meshes in bind pose. `RiggedMeshShaderProgram` exists; wiring it
  through is a per-instance joint-UBO upload (the same pattern
  `DrawableAvatarStore.updateJoints` already uses).
- **Sculpts.** Pcode 9 sculpt prims (textured heightfield) don't have
  a path here yet. Singularity treats them as a special primitive
  type that fetches a sculpt texture and rebuilds the mesh on the
  CPU; we'd need an analog `DrawableSculptStore`.
- **Hover text font atlas.** Each unique label currently gets its own
  texture. For scenes with hundreds of labels, an SDF atlas would
  drop GPU memory significantly.

---

## 9. Singularity Viewer cross-check

After the §8 roadmap landed we cross-checked the implementation against
the Singularity Viewer source (https://github.com/siana/SingularityViewer)
which is a direct LL viewer fork. The findings shaped a follow-up patch:

### Verified-aligned

- **Face counts**. `LLVolume::generate` in
  `indra/llmath/llvolume.cpp` emits 4 sides for a square profile
  (box), 3 for a triangle (prism), 1 for a circle (sphere /
  cylinder / torus); cap count is 2 when the path is open. Our
  `faceCountFor()` matches. `LLProfile::addHole` doubles cap
  faces when hollow > 0; we now mirror this.
- **Hover-text depth state**. `LLHUDText::renderText` wraps the draw
  in `LLGLDepthTest(GL_TRUE, GL_FALSE)` (test on, write off). Our
  `DrawableHoverText` sets `glDepthMask(false)` while keeping
  depth-test enabled — same behavior.
- **Hover-text billboarding**. `LLHUDText` calls
  `LLViewerCamera::getPixelVectors(mPositionAgent, y, x)` to derive
  screen-aligned basis vectors, then offsets `mPositionAgent` by
  `(x_pixel * dx) + (y_pixel * dy)`. We pull the camera right + up
  vectors out of the view matrix's first / second rows and build the
  billboard model matrix from them — equivalent up to an axis swap.
- **No alpha-to-coverage**. LL viewer / Singularity uses traditional
  alpha blending exclusively; so do we.
- **No driver-specific patches**. SingularityViewer has minimal
  Adreno/Mali workarounds — they rely on the `LLRender` abstraction
  layer. We follow the same pattern with our `glThreadGuard` +
  `RenderDiagnostics` capture.

### Patch landed from this cross-check

- **`glBlendFuncSeparate` everywhere we set a blend func.**
  `LLDrawPoolAlpha` in Singularity uses
  `(SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)` for color and
  `(ZERO, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)` for alpha. We were using
  `glBlendFunc` (single mode) which clobbers the alpha channel when
  rendering to the FXAA off-screen FBO — the FXAA resolve pass would
  then composite against an incorrect alpha. Swapped every site
  (transparent prims, water, hover text, HUD) to `glBlendFuncSeparate`.
- **Hollow prim caps doubled.** Per `LLProfile::addHole`,
  `for (i ...; if (mFaces[i].mCap) mFaces[i].mCount *= 2;)`. Added
  a `hollow` flag on `PrimInstance` and updated `faceCountFor` to
  return `sides + (hollow ? caps * 2 : caps)`. Hollow box now
  returns 8 faces; hollow cylinder returns 5.
- **Water depth-write off.** `LLDrawPoolWater` uses
  `LLGLDepthTest(GL_TRUE, GL_FALSE)` for transparent water so alpha
  geometry behind the water plane composites correctly. We now
  toggle `glDepthMask(false)` for the water pass and restore it
  after.

### Deferred (would require larger work)

- **Spatial bridges for rotated geometry.** `LLSpatialPartition` uses
  a "spatial bridge" when geometry is rotated — instead of expanding
  the AABB to the rotated bounds, it stores the rotated transform
  on the bridge and applies it when ray-testing. Our AABBs are
  scale-derived and over-estimate for rotated prims (acceptable
  conservative approach for picking + culling).
- **Tri-state frustum result.** LL viewer's `frustumCheck` returns
  out / partial / contained, which lets octree culling skip the
  per-prim test for fully-contained groups. We have a binary
  visible / not-visible test. Fine for our flat draw list.
- **Glow / emissive double-pass.** `LLDrawPoolAlpha` renders glowing
  prims twice — second pass with additive blend `(ONE, ONE)`. Our
  shader path doesn't yet emit glow.
- **Reflection / refraction textures for water.** `LLDrawPoolWater`
  binds `gPipeline.mWaterRef` (reflection FBO) and `mWaterDis`
  (distortion FBO). We use a simpler procedural water without
  off-screen reflection.
- **Distance-fade for hover text.** Singularity fades alpha beyond
  `mFadeDistance` instead of geometric scaling. We do geometric
  scaling with floor + ceiling. Either approach is defensible.

## 10. Testing

To force a backend at runtime without changing prefs, use:

```kotlin
PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(context)
    .edit().putString("renderer_backend", "filament").apply()
// Then re-launch WorldViewActivity, or rely on onResume's
// preferredRendererBackend() check to trigger a hot swap.
```

`RenderDiagnostics` exposes per-frame counters that the debug floater
button can capture; check for `glContextInfo` lines in the session
log to confirm the GL backend actually came up.
