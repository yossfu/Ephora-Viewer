/**
 * Fixed UDP Connection Handler for Second Life Protocol
 * 
 * This is the primary UDP connection implementation used throughout Linkpoint.
 * It provides comprehensive packet handling with full diagnostic capabilities
 * for debugging connection issues.
 * 
 * ## History & Design Decision
 * 
 * This class supersedes the original `UDPConnection.kt` implementation.
 * The "Fixed" suffix reflects the architectural improvements made:
 * - Better mobile network compatibility using NIO DatagramChannel
 * - Integrated MessageRouter for proper message dispatch
 * - EventBus integration for reactive updates
 * - Comprehensive diagnostic capabilities for debugging
 * 
 * The original UDPConnection.kt was removed from the codebase as it was
 * no longer used and this implementation covers all its functionality
 * with improved reliability and diagnostics.
 * 
 * ## Architecture Overview
 * 
 * This class implements the Second Life UDP protocol with proper message routing
 * and event bus integration, following Linkpoint architecture patterns.
 * 
 * ## Key Features
 * 
 * ### Message Routing
 * - Integrated MessageRouter for proper message handling
 * - EventBus integration for reactive updates across the app
 * - Support for all SL message frequencies (high, medium, low)
 * 
 * ### Diagnostic Capabilities (Critical for Debugging)
 * - **Full Packet Logging**: Records COMPLETE packet data (all bytes) for every packet
 *   - Enables full protocol diagnosis by capturing entire packet contents
 *   - Both sent and received packets are logged with complete hex dumps
 *   - Stored in circular buffer (configurable via [DEFAULT_PACKET_HISTORY_SIZE])
 * - **EnhancedPacketLogger Integration**: Comprehensive statistics and logging
 *   - Tracks packet counts, byte volumes, message types
 *   - Records malformed packets for protocol debugging
 * - **Socket Details**: Connection timing and state information
 *   - Local/remote addresses and ports
 *   - Connection attempt and last activity timestamps
 *   - Last error information for troubleshooting
 * 
 * ### Mobile-First Design
 * - Efficient resource usage with non-blocking NIO
 * - Battery-conscious operations with selective logging
 * - Memory-efficient buffering with bounded queues
 * - Configurable logging overhead via companion object constants
 * 
 * ## Usage
 * 
 * This class is instantiated by LinkpointApp and shared across managers.
 * Packet history and diagnostics are accessed via:
 * - `getPacketHistory()` - Recent packet events with FULL hex dumps
 * - `getSocketDetails()` - Connection state and timing
 * - `getDiagnostics()` - Overall connection diagnostics
 * - `getMessageStatistics()` - Message type counts and timing
 * 
 * ## Packet Data Logging
 * 
 * FULL raw packet data is logged for diagnostic purposes:
 * - Each sent packet: message ID, sequence number, size, COMPLETE hex dump
 * - Each received packet: message ID, sequence number, size, COMPLETE hex dump
 * - Failed operations include error messages
 * 
 * Full packet data is now captured by default for complete protocol diagnosis.
 * The number of packets kept in history is configurable via [DEFAULT_PACKET_HISTORY_SIZE].
 * 
 * This addresses the debugging need identified in issue reports:
 * "Not enough data is being gathered, we need raw input and output to understand"
 * 
 * @see EnhancedPacketLogger for detailed packet statistics
 * @see MessageRouter for message dispatch logic
 * @see DebugReportService for how diagnostics are displayed
